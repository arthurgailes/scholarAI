# scholarAI Package Rules

## Project Overview
- This is an R package called "scholarAI" for emulating American Enterprise Institute scholars

## Code Structure
- Package follows standard R package structure, compliant with tidyverse standards
- Documentation uses roxygen2 format
- Test files should be placed in tests/ directory
- Use pkg::fun inside functions, not library(pkg)
- Keep functions short and single-purpose.
- Prefer base R in functions, unless necessary or base R would be at least 5x more code

* **Object names** – use lower-case `snake_case`; functions are verbs (`add_row()`), data objects are nouns (`model_df`).  
* **File layout** – one exported function per file when possible; helpers follow the public function in the same file.  
* **Function signatures** – first argument is the primary data object; required args have no defaults; wrap long signatures one arg per line with 2-space indents.  
* **Comments** – explain **why**, not what; sentence-case lines starting with `# ` and separated from code by a blank line.  
* **Errors & messages** – use `{cli}` bullet-style errors (`cli_abort()` with ✖ / ℹ bullets) for human-centred diagnostics.  
* **API consistency** – design for human-centred, consistent, composable, inclusive interfaces (the four tidy-design principles).  
* **Documentation & exports** – every public function has a complete roxygen block (`@description`, `@return`, examples) and ends with `@export`; share parameters with `@inheritParams`.
